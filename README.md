QVHighlights is initially introduced as a moment retrieval dataset.
It generally contains user-created lifestyle vlog videos on YouTube, captured via different devices (smartphones or GoPro) with different angles (first-person or third-person).
Particularly, we use the training and validation sets of QVHighlights for evaluating PRVR since dense annotations~(possibly needed for future analysis) are not available for the test set.
To align with the partially relevant video retrieval~(PRVR) task, we reorganized the dataset by merging videos originating from the same source, resulting in an average of 3.3 text queries per video. 
Consequently, QVHighlights for the PRVR contains 2,214 videos in the training set and 474 videos in the test set while preserving the original 7,218 and 1,550 text queries, respectively.
